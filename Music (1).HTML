<p>Welcome to our blog everyone this is the blog of group 3, and now we were doing our blog about our experiences while listening to MUSIC, which is our topic (MUSIC) for this blog.</p>
<br>
<p>First, what is the importance of music? For us the importance of music is the relaxation it’s giving to us when we’re listening any kind of music, specially when music is related on our situation.</p>
<br>
<p>Also listening to music is giving us the energy to do our house chores, for example is when you’re sweeping, washing dishes, mopping, etc. of course we will never forget listening to music while doing that.</p>
<br>
